        "description": "In working on this website, all measures were taken to ensure a high quality of navigation, usability and user experience. In particular,<br><ul><li><b>3D Geometry</b>:<br>The objects selected for modelling presented a high degree of complexity, and were built with performance in mind. In this, each model contains the lowest amount of polys to maintain the realistic look that characterises this Web 3D experience.</li><li><b>Photorealistic texturing & rendering</b>:<br>The rendering takes advantage of photorealistic textures, edited using Photoshop for brightness, contrast, curves, colour correction and background, to provide an immersive experience. Additionally, a cloth simulation was made using physics and Cloth modifiers to create beautiful and realistic renders for each model.</li><li><b>CSS Styling</b>:<br>The 3D App was designed with usability and user experience in mind. Fluid grid layouts were used where appropriate, and input features were redesigned to override the default Bootstrap 4 ones (i.e. by recreating a style and colour theme and respecting it throughout the app) to create a unique experience.<ul><li><b>Lightboxes</b> were used to improve the gallery navigation experience;</li><li><b>Text and Image Keyframe-Based Animations</b> were implemented to improve the aesthetic of the home page;</li><li>A <b>Sidebar</b> was implemented because considered a better, more user-friendly way of navigating when designing the 3D App to be Mobile-First;</li><li><b>Smooth Transitions Between Content</b> were achieved using the fadeIn() JQuery function when fetching and swapping divs within the 3D App;</li><li>Both <b>Slideshow & Cards Gallery Navigation Modes</b> were provided to tailor the experience to all kind of users;</li><li><b>Full Responsiveness</b> allows the 3D App to be experienced optimally cross-platform, on all devices and screen sizes.</li></ul></li><li><b>Javascript/JQuery Interactivity & Relation to MVC Design Pattern</b>: Data included in the 3D App is read from a JSON file, stored in a SQLite database and fetched to the front-end using JQuery. This ensures a smooth content-insertion workflow, which takes advantage of an extended MVC design pattern and of an easy to manage database that includes all CRUD functions needed for the implementation. Content in the SPA is swapped using JQuery effects to improve the user experience.</li><li><b>3D Interactivity</b>: Animations are designed to be on theme with the object. Different camera views and lights are provided for user interaction, together with extra interactions such as a fog modifier. AnchorPoints were used to allow the user to click on the model to navigate to the webpage of the Royal Armouries Museum. Maximum care was taken with customised pivot points (for geometry, animation and with the VRML97 Helpers) to allow for optimal exporting and web interaction experience.</li></ul>"
